# The Sad Violin App (May 2024)

Welcome to the Tiny Sad Violin project! This is a fun little Flutter project I
created for personal enjoyment. Ever found yourself wishing for a tiny sad
violin to enhance your storytelling? Well, I did too, so I decided to make one!
This project aims to bring a touch of whimsy to storytelling by providing a
miniature virtual sad violin.
